    <h1>The Witch's Gift</h1>
    <h2>By Neishawn Johnson</h2>
    <p>My Project "The Witch's Gift" is about a neiborhood where kids are not outside because of the stale weather and the witch comes and changes the weather which makes them happy in return. I chose to this kind of stoy because i love magic and fiction. ALSO,i wanted to convey and symbolize having hope even when things dont work your way.</p>
